## Installation
```ruby
gem install hello_sign
```

## Configuration

HelloSign uses the [HTTP Basic Access Authentication][http_basic] scheme to authenticate API users.

To configure the client, simply execute the following with your credentials:

```ruby
HelloSign.configure do |hs|
  hs.email_address = 'david@bowman.com'
  hs.password      = 'hal_9000'
end
```

Those credentials will be used when making each request that requires authentication.

[http_basic]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication

### Thread safety

Applications that make requests on behalf of multiple HelloSign users should
avoid global configuration. Instead, instantiate a client directly.

```ruby
hello_sign = HelloSign::Client.new(email_address: 'david@bowman.com', password: 'hal_9000')
```

A client instantiated in this way responds to the same methods as the
`HelloSign` constant.

## Usage

All JSON-encoded responses from the HelloSign API are converted to a hash equivalent with symbols for keys before being returned.

### [Account](http://www.hellosign.com/api/reference#Account)

#### Create an account

```ruby
HelloSign.account.create(email_address: 'david@bowman.com', password: 'hal_9000')
```

Authentication is not required to make this request.

#### Fetch account settings

```ruby
HelloSign.account.settings.show
```

#### Update account settings

```ruby
HelloSign.account.settings.update(callback_url: 'https://callmemaybe.com')
```

### [Signature requests](http://www.hellosign.com/api/reference#SignatureRequest)

#### Send a request

```ruby
HelloSign.signature_request.deliver do |request|
  request.title   = 'Contract'
  request.subject = 'Here is the contract for you to sign!'
  request.message = 'You should definitely sign this.'
  request.ccs     = ['lawyer@lawfirm.com', 'spouse@family.com']
  request.signers = [
    {name: 'Jack', email_address: 'jack@hill.com'},
    {name: 'Jill', email_address: 'jill@hill.com'}
  ]
  request.files   = [
    {filename: 'path/to/contract.pdf'},
    {filename: 'details.txt', io: text_file},
    {filename: 'path/to/directions.txt', mime: 'text/xml'},
    {io: image, mime: 'image/jpeg'}
  ]
  request.form_fields_per_document = [
    [
      {
        type:     'text',
        x:        112,
        y:        328,
        width:    100,
        height:   16,
        required: true,
        signer:   1
      }
    ],
    []
  ]
end
```

##### Specifying files

There are a couple ways to specify a file when sending a signature request:

* Provide a path to the file's location on disk using `filename`.
* Pass a Ruby IO object using `io` (e.g. `text_file` and `image` above).

Other things to keep in mind:

* If a `filename` isn't provided, a generic one will be inferred.
* If no `mime` key is specified, the MIME type will be inferred by the file extension. If a MIME type cannot be inferred, it will default to `text/plain`.
* When using any method of file specification, the MIME type can always be overriden using the `mime` key.

#### Send a request using a reusable form

```ruby
HelloSign.signature_request.deliver(form: 'form_id') do |request|
  request.title         = 'Contract'
  request.subject       = 'Here is the contract for you to sign!'
  request.message       = 'You should definitely sign this.'
  request.ccs           = [
    {email_address: 'lawyer@lawfirm.com', role: 'lawyer'},
    {email_address: 'accountant@llc.com', role: 'accountant'}
  ]
  request.signers       = [
    {name: 'Jack', email_address: 'jack@hill.com', role: 'consultant'},
    {name: 'Jill', email_address: 'jill@hill.com', role: 'client'}
  ]
  request.custom_fields = [
    {name: 'cost', value: '$20,000'},
    {name: 'time', value: 'two weeks'}
  ]
end
```

#### Fetch the status on a request
```ruby
HelloSign.signature_request('abc123').status
```

#### Fetch a list of all requests

```ruby
HelloSign.signature_request.list
HelloSign.signature_request.list(page: 5)
```

Defaults to page one when no page number is provided.

#### Send a reminder
```ruby
HelloSign.signature_request('abc123').remind(email_address: 'bob@smith.com')
```

#### Cancel a request
```ruby
HelloSign.signature_request('abc123').cancel
```

#### Fetch a final copy
```ruby
HelloSign.signature_request('abc123').final_copy
```

### [Reusable forms](http://www.hellosign.com/api/reference#ReusableForm)

#### Fetch a list of all forms

```ruby
HelloSign.reusable_form.list
HelloSign.reusable_form.list(page: 5)
```

Defaults to page one when no page number is provided.

#### Fetch details on a form
```ruby
HelloSign.reusable_form('abc123').show
```

#### Grant access to a form
```ruby
HelloSign.reusable_form('abc123').grant_access(email_address: 'bob@smith.com')
HelloSign.reusable_form('abc123').grant_access(account_id: '123456')
```

#### Revoke access to a form
```ruby
HelloSign.reusable_form('abc123').revoke_access(email_address: 'bob@smith.com')
HelloSign.reusable_form('abc123').revoke_access(account_id: '123456')
```

### [Teams](http://www.hellosign.com/api/reference#Team)

```

#### Remove a member from the team
```ruby
HelloSign.team.remove_member(email_address: 'old@person.com')
HelloSign.team.remove_member(account_id: '123456')
```

### [Unclaimed drafts](http://www.hellosign.com/api/reference#UnclaimedDraft)

#### Create a draft
```ruby
HelloSign.unclaimed_draft.create do |draft|
  draft.files = [
    {filename: 'path/to/test.txt'},
